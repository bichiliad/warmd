WRCT: A Radio Music Database


Overview
========

The current database system at WRCT is a collection of perl scripts held together by ducktape, shoelaces, and the prayers of tiny children.
We aim to fix that. We're writing the project in Node, because we can't see Javascript going anywhere in the near future.
