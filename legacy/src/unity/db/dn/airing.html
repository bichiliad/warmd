<H3>Starting the show:</h3>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>The satellite feed is on Channel 3 (third from the left) of the air studio board, behind 'MCR' ('PHONE' is also behind MCR, so you may see PHONE in the display instead).  To change the input to the satellite feed, push the 'IN' button above the channel's fader (the light above 'IN' should come on - the channel cannot be "hot" at the time for this to work).  Then turn the green 'SELECT' knob (all the way to the right of the board) until 'SATFEED' is displayed in Channel 3's window where it usually says 'MCR' (or 'PHONE').  You must press the white 'TAKE' button (located below the 'SELECT' knob) to lock in 'SATFEED' as Channel 3's source.</P>
<LI>
<P>Raise the transmitter a few minutes before the top of the hour, and play music leading up to 8:00.  You want to be monitoring the SATFEED in cue.  Remember that the cue speaker may have been left turned down by the last DJ, so be sure it's turned back up so you don't miss the warning that DN is about to start.  Pacifica sends silence until Democracy Now! starts, so you should just hear faint static in the cue speaker.</P>
<LI>
<P>The intro cart for Democracy Now! is PA7 -- DN DISCLAIMER (30.0 sec).  This is essentially just the old timeshift cart, without the timeshift disclaimer.  The cart contains a legal station ID.  Pacifica sends a tone over the satellite feed 40 seconds before beginning Democracy Now!.  The tone itself lasts for 30 seconds, and it is followed by 10 seconds of silence.  Start the DN DISCLAIMER cart approximately 10 seconds past when you hear the tone begin in the cue speaker, then fade up the SATFEED channel after the cart is finished playing.</P>
<LI>
<P>Once Democracy Now! starts and it's potted up on the board, there's not much to do but stand there and make sure nothing goes wrong.  That said - always have a music CD cue'd up and ready to go, just in case something happens to the satellite feed.  Alternatively, you can burn a copy of the previous day's DN! and start it at the same time today's show begins, keeping it on a channel that's turned off on the board.  If you need it, it will be the proper duration into the show.</P>

<H3>What to do during station breaks:</H3>
<P>There are usually three station breaks (music breaks) during Democracy Now!.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>During the first music break, the Pittsburgh Campaign for Democracy Now underwriting cart should be played:  PADNU1 -- UNDERWRITER PCDN (31.0 sec).</P>
<LI>
<P>During the second music break, read one of the following promos for WRCT's evening Public Affairs shows.  Note that on days where there is both a 6pm and a 7pm PA show, you probably don't have time to read the promo for both.  Choose one, or use two music breaks (and skip the volunteer promo below).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><BIG>

<LI><P>During the third music break, read the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><BIG>
<P>You're listening to Democracy Now! on WRCT 88.3FM.  This program is brought to you each morning by the efforts of a group of WRCT DJs who volunteer their time.  We need more help keeping Democracy Now! on the air.  If you're interested in training to volunteer, you can contact the Public Affairs department by emailing pa@wrct.org.</P>

</OL>

<H3>Between shows:</H3>
<P>If you're airing DN on one of the mornings that the show repeats (for Fall 2004, this is Friday only, unless the DJ who follows DN fails to show up and you feel like sticking around), you will need to have extra music cue'd up to fill the space between the shows.</P>
<P>Between the 8am and 9am hours of Democracy Now!, Pacifica repeats the 30-second tone and 10 seconds of silence.  After the end of the first DN, there will be 10-15 seconds of silence before the tone starts.  Have music cue'd up to play while waiting for the tone to start in the cue speaker, wait 10 seconds into the tone, and fade the music down and restart the PA7 -- DN DISCLAIMER cart.</P>

<H3>After the show:</H3>
<P>After Democracy Now!, play cart PA7 -- DN DISCLAIMER (30.0 sec) again.  This cart contains a legal station ID.</P>
