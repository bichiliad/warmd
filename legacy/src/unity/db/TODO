- check out FULLTEXT index for searching review fields for relevence

- add albums to database from playlist (year, genre, checkbox)
	- maybe have plays in CSV table while editing?
	- OR ask users about AltAlbum entries after done with playlist

	- This has been started. What's needed:
		- A wrapper frame around the entry page that,
		  when you're done, will let you update the playlist.

- entry.cgi multiple search field matches should display 'lists' like in display.cgi - DONE (in that there are links to the records now)


- Entering review synopsis on the same page as "enter a new album."
	- This is a Tough Problem(tm) -- we need some way to keep
	  track of which forms are being submitted, since we essentially
	  have 2 or more distinct forms.
	- Another approach -- have a series of entry pages,
	  and only pass along the remaining tables as state

- Printing out review cards.
