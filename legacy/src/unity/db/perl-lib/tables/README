########### Table Description Specifications ##############

A table description is a hash that is intended to be used
in a somewhat object oriented manner (there are no member
functions, but maybe those will be added in the future).
A reference to the hash is returned by the function TblInit;
since the function is the same in every file, including multiple
table descriptions will override the previous TblInit, so be
careful.

Properties:

{name}	- the name of the data being handled by the table.
{table}	- the actual name of the table (should be {name}.'s')
{fields}- a hashref, the keys of which are all of the fields
	  in the table except the {name}ID field, if it exists.
	{longname} - a caption to be displayed by the field
	{type}	- information that describes how it should be displayed
		- default type is text
		{choose} will look up the {name} field on an ID field that
			references another table and display all of its
			records in a choose box
		{date}	will automatically fill in today's date
		{enum}	(also needs {values}) like a choose, but has a
			predefined set of values.
		{passwd} a password field
	{max}	- defines the maximum length of a text field
{ID}	- indicates where there is a "{name}ID" field as an
	  autoincrementing primary key
{alpha}	- the field that should be searched when clicking alphabet
	  links in display.cgi, if any
{sortby}- the default "ORDER BY" in a SQL select
{order}	- the default order that fields should be displayed
{edit}  - editing links to be displayed in addition to the default ones
	{img}	the name of the icon to be displayed (defined in interface.pl)
	{url}	the href of the link
		- the string "*fields.foo" is replaced by the value of
		  field "foo" in the current table.
	{caption} the text caption of the link
{lists} - tables to be displayed in extended view. The specified tables
	  should have "{name}ID" fields in them.
