These directories contain the interface for the WRCT database, which has
as its ultimate design goal the ability to enter and access most of the
station's data (library, playlists, logs, etc.) via a web-based interface.
Each of the directories should be symlinked as necessary to create a functional
database; const.pl in the perl-lib directory will give you some 
idea of where the symlinks should be. Also note the use of $ENV{WWW_SITE}:
this is an environment variable defined in an apache directive in
the httpd.conf.

* cgi-bin contains all of the cgi scripts that will be displayed. So far,
  all cgi scripts are general and take a 'tbl' parameter that specifies
  the table to be edited or displayed. This will change.
	- delete.cgi deletes one or more records: it must have certain
	  cgi parameters present for it to work.
	- display.cgi displays records in table form or in a more
	  readable layout (planned).
	- entry.cgi is for entry of records

* perl-lib contains the library files that do the low-level work of adding,
  deleting, and displaying records, among other things.
	- const.pl defines global constants
	- db.pl creates a global database handler with a connection to the database
	- error.pl contains error-handling procedures
	- form.pl contains procedures for displaying entry forms
	- interface.pl contains procedures for displaying images, headers
	  and footers, and other interface elements that will be reused
	- record.pl contains procedures for displaying and manipulating records
	  (including some functions that deal with table definitions)
	- sql.pl contains functions for sending sql queries to the database;
	  they return records or other information where appropriate.
	- the 'tables' subdirectory contains table definition files for each
	  table in the database. These definitions include some information
	  which can be extracted from the database, but also a substantial
	  amount of information which cannot be extracted.

* img contains all the images used in the interface.

* inc contains server-side include files, such as header and footer files.

* style contains cascading style sheets files

* wrct.sql is a series of sql statements that can be used to create the database
  with no data in it.
